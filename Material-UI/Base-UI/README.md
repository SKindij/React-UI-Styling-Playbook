# [Base UI](https://mui.com/base-ui/getting-started/)
It is a library of headless ("unstyled") React UI components and low-level hooks.

Advantages of Base UI
* Ship faster: 
  - it gives you the foundational building blocks you need to assemble a sleek and sophisticated user interface in a fraction of the time that it would take to do it all from scratch;
* You own the CSS: 
  - unlike Material UI, which uses Emotion as a default style engine, it has no built-in styling solution;
  - this means you have complete control over your app's CSS;
* Accessibility: 
  - its components are built with accessibility in mind;
  - we do our best to make all components screen reader-friendly;
  - we offer suggestions for optimizing accessibility throughout our documentation.

> _Base UI features many of the same components as Material UI, but without the Material Design implementation._\
> _In fact, future versions of Material UI (v6) will use these components and hooks for their foundational structure._

&emsp; Installation: ``npm install @mui/base``
