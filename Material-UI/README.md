# MUI Core
It contains foundational React UI component libraries for shipping new features faster.
  * [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started) - comprehensive library of components that features implementation of Google's Material Design system.
  * [Joy UI](https://github.com/SKindij/React-UI-Styling-Playbook/tree/main/Material-UI/Joy-UI) - beautifully designed library of React UI components.
  * [Base UI](https://github.com/SKindij/React-UI-Styling-Playbook/tree/main/Material-UI/Base-UI) - library of "unstyled" components and low-level hooks. You gain complete control over app's CSS and accessibility features.
  * [MUI System](https://github.com/SKindij/React-UI-Styling-Playbook/tree/main/Material-UI/MUI-System) - collection of CSS utilities to help you rapidly lay out custom designs.

&emsp; These sections help organize the MUI library and provide you with convenient tools for creating web applications using Material Design principles. Depending on your needs, you can use basic Material UI components, experiment with new features in Joy UI, use base components with Base UI, or create your own components with MUI System.

&emsp; Since Material UI components are built to function in isolation, they don't require any kind of globally scoped styles. For a better user experience and developer experience, we recommend adding the following globals to your app.
  * Responsive meta tag
    - > _Material UI is a mobile-first component libraryâ€”we write code for mobile devices first, and then scale up the components as necessary using CSS media queries._
    - > run ``<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width" />``
  * [CssBaseline](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-css-baseline/)
    - > _It helps to kickstart an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon._
    - > _It fixes some inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing resets that are better tailored to fit Material UI._
    -  ```javascript
            import * as React from 'react';
            import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';
            
            export default function MyApp() {
              return (
                <React.Fragment>
                  <CssBaseline />
                  {/* The rest of your application */}
                </React.Fragment>
              );
            } 
       ```
  * Default font
    - > _Material UI uses the Roboto font by default._
    - > run ``npm install @fontsource/roboto``,
      + then you can import it in your entry point like this:\
          ```javascript
            import '@fontsource/roboto/300.css';
            import '@fontsource/roboto/400.css';
            import '@fontsource/roboto/500.css';
            import '@fontsource/roboto/700.css';
          ```
    - using the Google Web Fonts CDN
      + inside your project's <head /> tag:
         ```html
            <link rel="stylesheet"
              href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
            />
          ```
  * Icons
    - > run ```npm install @mui/icons-material```

## [React Templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/)
> _&emsp; Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files, making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example) for reuse in other pages. For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes the purpose of each file._
