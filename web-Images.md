## Properly sizing images
&emsp;_Ideally, your page should never serve images that are larger than the version that's rendered on the user's screen.
Anything larger than that just results in wasted bytes and slows down page load time._

&emsp;**"Responsive images"** - main strategy for serving appropriately sized images. You generate multiple versions of each image, 
and then specify which version to use in your HTML or CSS using media queries, viewport dimensions, and so on.
