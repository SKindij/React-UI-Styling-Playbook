## Properly sizing images
&emsp;_Ideally, your page should never serve images that are larger than the version that's rendered on the user's screen.
Anything larger than that just results in wasted bytes and slows down page load time._

&emsp;**"Responsive images"** - main strategy for serving appropriately sized images. You generate multiple versions of each image, 
and then specify which version to use in your HTML or CSS using media queries, viewport dimensions, and so on. 
  * _Loading a large image and display it much smaller should be avoided to save bandwidth._
  * _Loading a small image and display it much larger should be avoided to prevent pixelated artifacts._

&emsp;When working with images in React web-app, there are a few key points to keep in mind:
* **Image Optimization:**
  + it is crucial to ensure faster loading times and better performance;
  + use image editing tools or online services to resize and compress your images before including them in your project;
  + this helps reduce the file size without significant loss in quality.
* **Responsive Images:**
  + make your images responsive by using CSS techniques or responsive image libraries like react-responsive or react-image;
  + this ensures that your images adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a better user experience.
* **Alt Text:** 
  + always include descriptive and meaningful alternative text (alt attribute) for your images;
  + this text is displayed when the image fails to load or for screen readers, providing accessibility for users with visual impairments.
* **Lazy Loading:**
  + implement lazy loading for images, especially if you have a page with many images or large-sized images;
  + it delays the loading of images until they are actually needed, improving initial page load times.
* **Image Formats:**
  + choose the appropriate image format based on the image content;
    - JPEG for photographs or complex images with gradients, 
    - PNG for images with transparency,  
    - SVG for vector graphics or logos;
  + selecting the right format can help reduce file size and optimize image quality.
* **Image Loading and Rendering:** 
  + consider how images are loaded and rendered in your application;
  + you can use placeholders or loading spinners to indicate that an image is being loaded;
  + additionally, optimize the rendering process by using techniques like progressive rendering, or using lower resolution images initially and swapping them with higher resolution versions later.
* **Image Caching:** 
  + utilize browser caching techniques to cache images on client-side, reducing subsequent requests and improving overall performance;
  + you can set appropriate cache headers on server or use caching libraries like swr or react-query to handle caching in your React-app.
* **CDN Usage:**
  + consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to faster deliver your images to users across different geographical regions;
  + CDNs store copies of your images in multiple locations worldwide.

> _&emsp;HTML makes it possible to load different images depending on different conditions. A common situation: different pictures for different screen widths._
> _&emsp;When working with responsive images, it's generally recommended to provide multiple versions of the same image at different sizes.
> This approach helps ensure that the most appropriate image is served based on the user's device capabilities and screen size._\
> _&emsp;By providing multiple versions, you can optimize loading speed and bandwidth usage for different devices. Smaller devices with lower-resolution screens can benefit from smaller images, while larger devices with higher-resolution screens can receive higher-quality images._

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/SKindij/SKindij/blob/main/recources/srcset-sizes.png" 
    title="srcset-sizes" alt="srcset and sizes" width="600" height="400"/>  
</p> 

+ **src:**
  - This is an attribute that specifies the path to an image.
  -  It is the primary image that will be used if none of the alternative versions match the screen size.
+ **srcSet:**
  - This is an attribute that contains a list of alternative images along with their sizes.
  - This means that the browser can choose the appropriate version of the image based on the viewport size to ensure optimal loading and display.
 + **sizes:**
  - This is an attribute that specifies the sizes of the image for different screen sizes.
  - The block width for an image can be specified in any unit of measurement, except for percentages.

> ```HTML
>  <Card.Img variant="top" 
>    src={garageRolles}
>    srcSet={`
>         ${garageRollets334} 334w, 
>         ${garageRollets668} 668w, 
>         ${garageRollets916} 916w, 
>         ${garageRollets1068} 1068w`}
>     sizes="
>         (max-width:767px) 334px, 
>         (max-width:991px) 668px, 
>         (max-width:1399px) 916px",
>         1068px"
>         className="img-fluid img-thumbnail" 
>         alt="roller gate"
>  />  
> ```

How the browser reads these attributes:
1. Looks at the device's screen width.
2. Attempts to determine the appropriate condition from the list in the sizes attribute.
3. Look at the block size for the image to this media expression.
4. Loads that image from the list in srcset, which has the same size as the selected slot.
5. If there is none, then first image that is larger than size of the selected slot will be loaded.


If your image is in a container, you can use CSS to resize the image to the width of that container.
> ```CSS
>  img {
>    height: auto;
>    width: 100%;
>  }
> ```
